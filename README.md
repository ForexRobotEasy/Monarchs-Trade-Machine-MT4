## Description

The Monarchs Trade Machine MT4 is a trading robot that executes trades based on predefined trading signals and strategies. It uses various libraries and functions to handle trade operations, position information, symbol information, and trade signals.

The code initializes the necessary libraries and defines the required variables. The user has the option to customize the trading strategy mode, maximum lot size, maximum deposit load, maximum number of simultaneous trades, real-time data analysis, and error handling.

The code then initializes the trade robot and trade signals for each currency pair. The `InitTradingFunctions()` function is called to initialize the trade robot and trade signals.

The `StartTrading()` function is responsible for executing trades based on the selected trading strategy mode and the trading signals for each currency pair. It checks the validity of the trading strategy mode, deposit load, and maximum number of simultaneous trades before opening positions.

The `OnTick()` function is the main entry point and is called on every tick of the market. It performs real-time data analysis if enabled and then calls the `StartTrading()` function to initiate trades.

The `OnTradeError()` function handles trade errors if error handling is enabled. The `Log()` function is used for logging trading activity and errors.
